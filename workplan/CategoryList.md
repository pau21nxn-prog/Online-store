### Developer-friendly structure (example JSON shape)

Use a flat table with parent references or a nested structure. Here’s a compact shape you can adopt:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "fashion",
    "name": "Fashion & Apparel",
    "children": [
      {"id": "fashion-women", "name": "Women", "children": [
        {"id": "fashion-women-tops", "name": "Tops"},
        {"id": "fashion-women-dresses", "name": "Dresses & Jumpsuits"},
        {"id": "fashion-women-bottoms", "name": "Bottoms"}
      ]},
      {"id": "fashion-men", "name": "Men"},
      {"id": "fashion-kids", "name": "Kids & Baby Clothing"},
      {"id": "fashion-accessories", "name": "Accessories"}

### Tips for implementation

* Keep slugs stable (e.g., `home-improvement`) and store display names separately for localization.
* Limit depth to 2–3 levels for UX; rely on filters (brand, price, size, color) beyond that.
* Allow items to live in multiple subcategories via tags (e.g., “air fryer” under **Small Appliances** and tagged **Healthy Cooking**).
* Add a “Featured / New In / Bestsellers / Mall Picks” virtual category that’s driven by rules, not hardcoded.
